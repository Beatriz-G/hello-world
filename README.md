This new repository is to practice the GitHub flow =)

Hello, my name is Beatriz. I am practicing GitHub flow steps and want to make sure that I understand this better. 

I look forward to working with you and others on this new exciting journey.

This is the second time that I am practicing doing a branch, pull request and commiting the changes. 
So exciting!


This is the third time I get do a branch and pull request! Super excited to keep practicing this! 

I also got the Pull Shark award for trying this new exercise!!!


Here we go, fourth time!!! I am super excited!! i am trying to do this branch, pull request and commit from memory so wish me luck!!!

Here again to do another pull request!!! So far so good! I am learning to do this from memory, occasionally checking the directions but overall doing good!
