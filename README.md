# hello-world
This new repository is to practice the GitHub flow =)

Hello, my name is Beatriz. I am practicing GitHub flow steps and want to make sure that I understand this better. 

I look forward to working with you and others on this new exciting journey.

This is the second time that I am practicing doing a branch, pull requet and commiting the changes. 
So exciting!
